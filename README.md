Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate - my own notes from training program:

<b> Key concepts as a Cybersecurity Analyst </b>

**_Compliance_** is the process of adhering to internal standards and external regulations and enables organizations to avoid fines and security breaches.

_**Security frameworks**_ are guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy.

_**Security controls**_ are safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks. They are used with security frameworks to establish a strong security posture.

_**Security posture**_ is an organization’s ability to manage its defense of critical assets and data and react to change. A strong security posture leads to lower risk for the organization.

A _**threat actor**_, or malicious attacker, is any person or group who presents a security risk. This risk can relate to computers, applications, networks, and data.

An _**internal threat**_ can be a current or former employee, an external vendor, or a trusted partner who poses a security risk. At times, an internal threat is accidental. For example, an employee who accidentally clicks on a malicious email link would be considered an accidental threat. Other times, the internal threat actor intentionally engages in risky activities, such as unauthorized data access.

_**Network security**_ is the practice of keeping an organization's network infrastructure secure from unauthorized access. This includes data, services, systems, and devices that are stored in an organization’s network.

_**Cloud security**_ is the process of ensuring that assets stored in the cloud are properly configured, or set up correctly, and access to those assets is limited to authorized users. The cloud is a network made up of a collection of servers or computers that store resources and data in remote physical locations known as data centers that can be accessed via the internet. Cloud security is a growing subfield of cybersecurity that specifically focuses on the protection of data, applications, and infrastructure in the cloud.

_**Programming**_ is a process that can be used to create a specific set of instructions for a computer to execute tasks. These tasks can include:

- Automation of repetitive tasks (e.g., searching a list of malicious domains)

- Reviewing web traffic 

- Alerting suspicious activity
